# Crop-Analysis-using-Remote-Sensing-Data-for-Vineyard-Management

The objective was to carry out various analysis using remote sensing for applying precision agriculture practices on Vineyard management. The input data given were 2 KML file for two farm plot of the study area. The area of interest lies under Kadawa Mhalungi village of Dindori tehsil in Nasik District in Maharashtra state.

Satellite data used for the following analysis is Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance data (10m), CHIRPS Precipitation data (5km) and MODIS Land Surface Temperature data (1km). The platform for creating and executing the code is Google Colab. As per the time range several satellite images were needed to be downloaded for processing and further analysis hence Google Earth Engine was used to efficiently download these large datasets and process it on the fly without heavy machine usage.

Few hurdles in carrying out the assignment were –
1. Non availability of High Resolution Satellite Imagery or Drone Imagery for Weed Analysis, Plant Disease
Analysis and Plant Population Count.
2. Missing spatial attributes like water source location.
3. Coordinates for location where high weed cover and cluster of diseased plant were found.
